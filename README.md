This a stock Market Prediction App created by using Python and machine learning, I used LSTM Model to predict The Stock Price and build an interactive dashboard for stock analysis using OTOH, Plotly dash python framework for building dashboards.
##### This App also has 15 Tech Companies High vs Low Stock Prices Data and Volume analysis

# DataSet Creation
For data collection I used yahoo finance. Yahoo Finance is a database with stock prices for various companies. Most of the companies I chose were in the sector of technology. Ex. Apple, Google, Yahoo, Microsoft etc. I collected data from January 2010 to December 2016. The stock market took a toll during 2007-2008 financial crisis. This time around, companies went in loss and stock data of companies completely unpredictable. Training our model using this data would cause our model to be less accurate because of a lack of trend during the crisis period. So I avoided data that can result into uncertain behaviour
The data set contains stock data of the following companies:
* Yahoo
* Microsoft
* Apple
* Google
* Tesla
* Intel
* AMD
* Amazon
* Oracle
* Tata Motors
* Facebook
* IBM
* Netflix
* Accenture
* NVIDIA
